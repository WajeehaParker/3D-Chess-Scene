This is a 3D model for chess.
each part is drawn at origin and then scaled and translated to its position.
Camera can be moved with the following keys:
l: left
r: right
u: up
d: down

There was a problem that i was not able to solve:
When I tried to map the texture on board, lights were being disabled.
Texture was provided in the file named "chessBoard.bmp".
Texture mapping was done in texturing() method called within wall() function

1 part of chess was left that i was not able to draw properly-"the knight"
